Framework agnostic PHP classes for utilizing the Project Honey Pot Blacklist
http://www.projecthoneypot.org

The HTTP Blacklist, or "http:BL", is a system that allows website administrators to take advantage of the data generated by Project Honey Pot in order to keep suspicious and malicious web robots off their sites. Project Honey Pot tracks harvesters, comment spammers, and other suspicious visitors to websites. Http:BL makes this data available to any member of Project Honey Pot in an easy and efficient way.

Http:BL provides data back about the IP addresses of visitors to your website. Data is exchanged over the DNS system. You may query your local DNS server and receive a response back that indicates the type of visitor to your site, how threatening that visitor is, and how long it has been since the visitor has last been seen within the Project Honey Pot trap network.


Ex. Inspect an IP Address and Analyze Behavior

$h = new ProjectHoneyPot('216.152.250.148', $apikey);

$h->hasRecord(); // returns TRUE
$h->getThreatScore(); // returns 65
$h->isSearchEngine(); // returns FALSE
$h->isContentSpammer(); // returns TRUE
$h->isSuspicious(); // returns TRUE
$h->isHarvester(); // returns FALSE
